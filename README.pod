=head1 NAME

Task::CoreModules - All the modules that should have been installed for your perl

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ cpanm Task::CoreModules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a distribution that contains no code of its own, but merely declares dependencies on a number of other
modules: all the modules that should have been bundled with your version of Perl, but may have been omitted due to
overly-zealous distribution package managers who decided to omit some modules to "save space".

Simply declare a dependency on C<Task::CoreModules> in your project, and when installed, all core modules are
installed. If you already have them, then no action is taken.

=head1 FUNCTIONS/METHODS

None.
